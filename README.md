This is a custom frontend implementation of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's [React Meals](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) project (as of 2023), built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**.

## Enhancements & Features

This version extends the original project with additional functionality:

- **New Backend Integration**  
  A backend service is available here: [ReactMealsTS_BackEnd](https://github.com/kar-dim/ReactMealsTS_BackEnd)  
  It provides API endpoints for managing orders, dishes, and users.

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  - Integrated with **Auth0** for secure login.
  - **Role-based access control** is implemented:
    - Regular users can place orders.
    - Users with the `"Admin"` role can also edit the menu and manage users via backend services.

- **Deployment**  
  - May be configured for **Vercel** deployment.
  - To build for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
